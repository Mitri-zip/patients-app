# Inspiration:

I built this project to apply and grow my full-stack development skills by creating a real-world patient tracking system with AI support.
The inspiration came from a desire to streamline how clinics and hospitals manage patient records, improve communication between patients and doctors, and provide a secure digital workflow similar to a real medical setting.

The goal was to allow patients and healthcare providers to interact through a centralized, efficient system â€” cutting down paperwork and improving record accessibility.
This project challenged me to implement real authentication, role-based access, record editing features, and integrate generative AI to assist in clinical decision-making.

# What it Does:
Patients App Tracker is a secure full-stack web application where both patients and doctors can log in to manage and view patient records.
It provides a streamlined digital healthcare workflow built with modern web technologies and features role-based access.

# Key Features:  
For Patients:
Sign in to access their personal profile
View their medical history, test results, and past diagnoses
See doctor notes and ongoing treatment plans
Secure and private: patients cannot see other patient data

For Doctors:
Log into their Doctor Dashboard
Search for patients by name or ID
View each patient's full medical profile and records
Click Edit to start a new diagnosis session for any patient

This includes sections for:
Medical History
Symptoms
Physical Examination
Vitals
Medications
Test Results
All updates are securely added to that patient's historical records

AI Assistant:
Powered by ChatGPT, the system assists doctors during diagnosis sessions by offering suggestions and prompts based on symptoms and notes.

# How it Was Built: 
Tech Stack:
Frontend: React.js (Hooks, Context API)
Backend: Node.js + Express.js
Database: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
Authentication: JSON Web Tokens (JWT) with role-based access
AI Integration: ChatGPT API for clinical support

Highlights:
Mongoose used to structure and validate complex nested schemas (e.g., patient sessions and diagnoses)
Secure routes for patients and doctors to ensure data privacy
Doctors can only edit patient data through protected endpoints
Fully responsive UI, user-friendly forms, and intuitive dashboards
Axios used for smooth frontend-backend communication
